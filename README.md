I am a Ph.D Student studying the ecology and evolution of ants and a member of the [Moreau Lab](https://www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu/) and the Department of [Entomology](https://entomology.cals.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska but have also lived in New Jersey and Rhode Island. I earned a BA in Biology with a minor in History from the New Jersey Institute of Technology where I was advised by Dr. Phil Barden. I am largely interested in the patterns of morphological diversity across ant lineages and how these patterns interact with ecological interactions and caste specialization.

## Outreach 

Science is so much more fun and enriching when everyone has a chance to interact and engage. I am passionate about communicating science to the general public! As a result, I have created coloring pages as a way to inspire children explore the subject of insect biology!
